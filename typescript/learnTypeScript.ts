// Why TypeScript was invented?
// JavaScript is good for smaller applications, but TypeScript was invented by Microsoft for bigger applications and less bugs

// Steps to begin a TypeScript file
// 1. To create a TypeScript file use .js at the end
// 2. Run the code through the transpiler to check if it can be read

// Exercise 1.
// In this exercise and throughout the lesson, we’ll provide you with a bash terminal to execute your code. We’ll be working with both TypeScript files (files with the extension .ts) and JavaScript files (files with the extension .js).

// The TypeScript transcompiler can be used on the command line by running the tsc command:

// tsc
// This will create an equivalent .js file in the same directory as well as surface any errors found by the TypeScript transcompiler.

// Run the TypeScript transcompiler using the tsc command.
